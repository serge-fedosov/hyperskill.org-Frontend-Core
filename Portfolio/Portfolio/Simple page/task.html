<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>So, let's start to create your personal portfolio. Note that we are not trying to collect or otherwise use any personal information about you and your career. Feel free to use random data in this project instead of your personal information!</p>
<p>In the first stage, you need to create a simple web page. It should have the following HTML elements: top-level heading, two second-level headings, at least one paragraph of text, and at least two images.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ol>
<li>Come up with a header for your future site and wrap it in a proper tag for a first-level heading.</li>
<li>Create a second-level heading with the text "About me".</li>
<li>Place your photo or any image that will represent you.</li>
<li>Put at least one paragraph of text on the site: this will be the personal biography section.</li>
<li>Create another second-level heading with the text "Portfolio".</li>
<li>Place at least one image that will represent your work experience and achievements.</li>
<li>Put a title or a project name under each image so that they don't appear out of context.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>Here is what your simple page is supposed to look like at the end of the stage implementation:</p>
<p><img alt="" height="775" src="https://ucarecdn.com/d14fe13c-ce16-446c-b3b4-3a4b2cd5e5e2/-/crop/607x941/69,139/-/preview/" width="500"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can download the images used on the web page from the example above, just follow <a href="https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/467516/images.zip" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the link to our storage.</a></p></body></html>
